# Rough timeline for class

- HW1: Feb 15 - March 1
- HW2: March 1 - March 15
- Project proposal: 1 page + Appendix, due on March 15
- (Maybe) HW3: March 22 - April 5
- Project Milestone 1: April 5
- Final project: May 3

### Final Project
The final project can be theoretical or empirical in any of the topics that are being covered in class. You can build on existing ideas from papers, or propose a new directions. 
- The project can be done in groups of up to 4
- We will have 5 min talks for each project at the end of class (details TBD)
- The project can also be a survey of some area, but if you choose to do this, it must be a very thorough survey of a new enough area that does not already have multiple survey papers.
- We will also release some (maybe half-baked) project ideas that the teaching staff has been thinking about that you can take up if you are interested
- We are very willing to advise with projects, so please reach out to us if you want to discuss at any point in the project!

### Swapping HW for projects:
In lieu of the homeworks, you can work on a much more substantial research project. If you choose this option, the project should be novel and substantial enough that it could be submitted as a workshop/conference paper to a top ML conference. We understand that all research projects do not reach that point, but that is the standard to aspire to! 

You will be required to submit a 8 page paper in the NeurIPS conference format (the next major ML conference)

If you opt for this, your timeline for the course will be:

- Project proposal: March 1
- Milestone 1: March 22
- Milestone 2: April 12
- Final project: May 3
